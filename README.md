# Facial-Expression-Detection
A real-time facial expression detection system that uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh and OpenCV to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions. This project focuses on detecting happiness and neutral emotions based on the mouth aspect ratio.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV (for computer vision and image processing)
MediaPipe (for facial landmark detection)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Tools:
OpenCV's Haar cascades (for face detection)
Features:
Real-time face detection
Facial landmark detection
Emotion classification (Happy and Neutral)
Mouth aspect ratio calculation
